# .___init__.py

## File Path

`./autodocs/generators/.___init__.py`

## Overview

This module serves as the initialization file for the `autodocs.generators` package. It likely handles package-level imports and potentially defines package-wide constants or configurations.  Since the docstring is missing, this is an inferred overview.

## Quick Reference

This file doesn't define any classes or functions directly. It primarily serves to make the `autodocs.generators` directory a Python package.

## Detailed Documentation

Since this file is an `__init__.py` file, it doesn't contain any directly callable classes or functions. Its primary function is to:

*   **Mark the directory as a Python package:**  The presence of `__init__.py` allows Python to recognize the directory as a package, enabling imports from modules within it.
*   **Potentially import modules:** It might contain import statements to make modules within the `autodocs.generators` package directly accessible when the package is imported.  For example:
    ```python
    # Example (hypothetical)
    # from .markdown_generator import MarkdownGenerator
    ```
*   **Potentially define package-level variables:** It could define variables or configurations that are accessible throughout the package.

## Usage Examples

The primary usage of this file is implicit.  When you import the `autodocs.generators` package, the code in this `__init__.py` file is executed.  For example:

```python
# Example (hypothetical)
import autodocs.generators

# If the __init__.py file contained:
# from .markdown_generator import MarkdownGenerator
# then you could do:
# generator = autodocs.generators.MarkdownGenerator()
```
