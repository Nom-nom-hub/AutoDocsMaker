## Overview

Base class for all language parsers

## Quick Reference

*   **Classes:**
    *   `BaseParser`
*   **Functions:**
    *   `__init__(config)`
    *   `parse(file_path)`
    *   `extract_docstring(text)`

## Detailed Documentation

### Class: `BaseParser`

Base class for all language parsers

#### Methods

##### `__init__(config)`

Constructor for the `BaseParser` class.  The `config` parameter is expected, but its type and usage are not specified in the provided code.  It likely contains configuration settings for the parser.

##### `parse(file_path)`

Parse a file and extract documentation

**Args:**

*   `file_path` (str): Path to the file to parse

**Returns:**

*   `dict`: Parsed documentation data. The structure of this dictionary is not defined in the base class and is likely to be implemented by subclasses.

##### `extract_docstring(text)`

Extract docstring from text.  The implementation details are not provided, meaning this is likely an abstract method that subclasses must implement.  It's designed to take a string (`text`) and return the docstring contained within it.

**Args:**

* `text` (str): The input string from which to extract the docstring.

**Returns:**

* The docstring extracted from the input text. The return type is not explicitly specified, but it is likely a string.

## Usage Examples

While specific usage examples cannot be fully determined from the base class alone (as it's likely abstract), we can infer some general patterns:

**1. Instantiation:**

```python
# Assuming a configuration object is available
config = {"some_setting": "some_value"}  # Example, actual config may vary
parser = BaseParser(config)
```

**2. Parsing a File:**

```python
file_path = "path/to/your/file.py"  # Replace with the actual file path
parsed_data = parser.parse(file_path)

# parsed_data now contains the extracted documentation
# The structure of parsed_data depends on the specific parser implementation
print(parsed_data)
```

**3. Extracting a Docstring (Conceptual - Requires Subclass Implementation):**

```python
# This is a conceptual example, as the base class doesn't implement
# extract_docstring.  A subclass would provide the actual implementation.

text_with_docstring = """
def my_function():
    \"\"\"This is the docstring.\"\"\"
    pass
"""
docstring = parser.extract_docstring(text_with_docstring)
print(docstring)  # Expected output (in a subclass): This is the docstring.
```

**Important Considerations:**

*   The `BaseParser` class is likely an abstract base class.  You would typically not instantiate it directly.  Instead, you would create subclasses that implement the `extract_docstring` method (and potentially override `parse` and `__init__` as needed) to handle specific programming languages.
*   The `config` parameter in `__init__` is not detailed.  Subclasses would likely define the expected structure and content of this configuration.
*   The return value of `parse` is a dictionary, but its structure is undefined in the base class.  Subclasses would define the keys and values of this dictionary to represent the extracted documentation.
* The return type of `extract_docstring` is not specified, but is likely a string.
