## Overview

This module serves as the entry point for the `autodocs` package. It likely handles package initialization and might import and expose key components of the package.

## Quick Reference

This module doesn't appear to define any classes or functions directly. It primarily serves as a package initializer.

## Detailed Documentation

Since this file primarily initializes the package, there are no classes or functions to document.

## Usage Examples

Because this is an initialization file, there are no direct usage examples. However, the presence of this file indicates that you can import the `autodocs` package in other Python files:

```python
import autodocs

# Now you can access submodules or components defined within the autodocs package.
