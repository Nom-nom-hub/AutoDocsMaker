## Usage Examples

Since this file is an `__init__.py` file, it's primarily used for package initialization and doesn't have direct usage examples in the typical sense. However, its presence enables the `autodocs` directory to be treated as a Python package.

Example of how the package might be imported:

```python
import autodocs
# or
from autodocs import some_module
```

The specific behavior depends on what other modules and subpackages are defined within the `autodocs` package. The `__init__.py` file itself doesn't have any directly callable functions or classes. It's more about setting up the package's namespace and making its contents accessible.
