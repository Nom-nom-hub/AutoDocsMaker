# .___init__.py

## File Path

`./autodocs/.___init__.py`

## Overview

This module serves as the initialization file for the `autodocs` package. It likely handles package-level imports and setup.  Since there's no docstring provided in the code, this section is based on the common purpose of `__init__.py` files.

## Quick Reference

This file doesn't define any classes or functions directly. It's primarily for package initialization.

## Detailed Documentation

Since this file is an initialization file, it doesn't contain any user-facing classes or functions to document. Its primary function is to make the `autodocs` directory a Python package.

## Usage Examples

The usage of this file is implicit. When you import the `autodocs` package, the code within `.___init__.py` (if any) is executed. For example:

```python
import autodocs
# This import triggers the execution of code within autodocs/.___init__.py
```

The specific actions performed by `.___init__.py` depend on its internal implementation, which is not available in the provided context. Common actions include:

*   Importing submodules: `from . import submodule1`
*   Setting package-level variables.
*   Performing initial setup tasks.
