# setup

## File Path

`./setup.py`

## Overview

This file is a standard `setup.py` file used for packaging and distributing Python projects. It leverages the `setuptools` library to define project metadata, dependencies, and other configuration options necessary for installation and distribution via tools like `pip`.

## Quick Reference

*   **Functions:**
    *   `setup()`:  The main function from `setuptools` used to configure the project.

## Detailed Documentation

### `setup()`

This function is imported from the `setuptools` module and is the primary entry point for defining the project's setup. It accepts various keyword arguments that specify project metadata, dependencies, and other configuration options.

*   **Purpose:** Configures the project for packaging and distribution.
*   **Usage:** Called directly within the `setup.py` file.
*   **Parameters:**  The parameters accepted by `setup()` are numerous and depend on the project's needs. Common parameters include:
    *   `name`: The name of the project (string).
    *   `version`: The version number of the project (string).
    *   `description`: A short description of the project (string).
    *   `long_description`: A longer description of the project (string).
    *   `author`: The author's name (string).
    *   `author_email`: The author's email address (string).
    *   `url`: The project's URL (string).
    *   `packages`: A list of Python packages to include (list of strings).  Often determined automatically using `find_packages()`.
    *   `install_requires`: A list of dependencies required for the project to run (list of strings, e.g., `['requests', 'numpy']`).
    *   `classifiers`: A list of classifiers to categorize the project (list of strings).
    *   `python_requires`: Specifies the required Python version (string, e.g., '>=3.7').
    *   `entry_points`: Defines entry points for command-line scripts or other extensions (dictionary).
    *   `package_data`: Specifies non-code files to include in packages (dictionary).
    *   `include_package_data`:  A boolean indicating whether to include data files specified in `MANIFEST.in` (boolean).

## Usage Examples

The following is a typical example of how `setup()` is used within a `setup.py` file.  This example is illustrative and would need to be adapted to the specific project.

```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name='my_project',
    version='0.1.0',
    description='A sample Python project',
    long_description=open('README.md').read(),
    author='Your Name',
    author_email='your.email@example.com',
    url='https://github.com/yourusername/my_project',
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=[
        'requests',
        'beautifulsoup4',
    ],
    classifiers=[
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3',
        'License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License',
        'Operating System :: OS Independent',
    ],
    python_requires='>=3.7',
)
```

To build and install the project, you would typically run the following commands in your terminal from the directory containing `setup.py`:

1.  **Build the package:** `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`
2.  **Install the package (editable mode - for development):** `pip install -e .`
3.  **Install the package (from a wheel file):** `pip install dist/my_project-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl` (replace with the actual wheel file name).
