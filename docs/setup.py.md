# setup

## File Path

`./setup.py`

## Overview

This file is a standard `setup.py` file used for packaging and distributing Python projects. It leverages `setuptools` to define project metadata, dependencies, and other build configurations.

## Quick Reference

*   **Functions:**
    *   `setup()`:  The main function from `setuptools` used to configure the project.

## Detailed Documentation

### `setup()`

The `setup()` function is the core function from the `setuptools` library. It takes keyword arguments to define the project's metadata and build configuration.  This function is not defined within the `setup.py` file itself, but is imported from the `setuptools` package.

**Parameters:**

The `setup()` function accepts a wide variety of parameters.  Commonly used parameters include:

*   `name`: The name of the project (string).
*   `version`: The version number of the project (string).
*   `description`: A short description of the project (string).
*   `long_description`: A longer description of the project (string).  Often read from a README file.
*   `author`: The author's name (string).
*   `author_email`: The author's email address (string).
*   `url`: The project's URL (string).
*   `packages`: A list of Python packages to include in the distribution (list of strings).  Often determined automatically using `find_packages()`.
*   `install_requires`: A list of package dependencies (list of strings).
*   `classifiers`: A list of strings that classify the project (list of strings).
*   `entry_points`:  Defines entry points for scripts or other functionality.  (dictionary).

**Returns:**

None.  The function configures the build process.

## Usage Examples

The `setup.py` file itself is not directly executed as part of the application's runtime.  Instead, it is used by build tools like `pip` to install the project.  Here's a conceptual example of how `setup.py` might be used:

**Example `setup.py` (Conceptual):**

```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name='my_awesome_package',
    version='1.0.0',
    description='A short description of my awesome package',
    long_description=open('README.md').read(),
    author='Your Name',
    author_email='your.email@example.com',
    url='https://github.com/yourusername/my_awesome_package',
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=[
        'requests',
        'beautifulsoup4',
    ],
    classifiers=[
        'Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable',
        'Intended Audience :: Developers',
        'License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3',
    ],
)
```

**How to use it (from the command line):**

1.  **Navigate to the directory containing `setup.py`:**

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project
    ```

2.  **Install the package using `pip`:**

    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

    This command will build and install the package based on the configuration in `setup.py`.  The `.` indicates that the package is located in the current directory.
